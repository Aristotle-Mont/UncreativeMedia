											FAQs
											<br>
											What Gear Do You Use?
											<br>
											
											Probably one of the most asked questions. While gear alone doesn't make someone great in this industry, I don't mind sharing what I use here!
											<br>
											<br>
											Where Do You Mainly Shoot?
											<br>
											
											I currently live near The Greater Seattle Area, so am always down to do shoots in the area. However, you can usually catch me flying around the country, such as California and Vegas for events or people that are willing to fly me out to shoot their car. 
											<br>
											<br>
											Will You Ever Do Tutorials?
											<br>
											Since the art form of automotive photography and videography is so unique per person, I say find and develop your own style. I might drop a few pointers here are there in the future, but I do not see myself doing full on tutorials ever.
											<br>
											<br>
											What is Your Turnaround Time For Shoots?
											<br>
											Typically photos take me about 1-2 weeks to complete a set and videos can take anywhere from 1 to 2 months. This can vary though depending on the project and any special requests. Quality > Quantity.
											<br>
											<br>
											What If I Get pulled over during the shoot?
											<br>
											During the shoot it's not uncommon I get pulled over for hanging out of a van, but there shouldn't be any reason you get pulled over unless you are doing something illegal, such as speeding. We don't condone speeding during the shoot as it's not required to get the shoot complete. That being said, you are responsible for your own tickets, as am I for mine.
